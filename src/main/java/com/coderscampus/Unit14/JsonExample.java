     *? JSON
     * ? JavaScript Object Notation
     * ? A simple String based way to notate data
     ** - Key : Value pairs
     *!   - Key : Value pairs are seperated by commas
     *!   - Objects are represented by curly brackets {}
     *!   - Arrays are represented by square brackets []
     *
     *? Important note: JSON is not tied to JavaScript... it is
     *?   language agnostic (meaning it'll work in any language)
     *
     ** JSON is just data passed around on the internet.
     ** From client to server then from server to client.
     ** It is the accepted way of passing data back-and-fourth from client to server.
     ** Or from one language to another via an API Endpoint
